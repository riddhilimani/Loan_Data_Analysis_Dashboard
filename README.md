# Loan_Data_Analysis_Dashboard
Your dataset consists of 500 loan records with 11 columns, including:

Loan Details: Loan_ID, Principal, terms, effective_date, due_date

Repayment Status: loan_status, paid_off_time, past_due_days

Demographics: age, education, Gender

Some loans have missing "paid_off_time" and "past_due_days" values, which could indicate defaults or late payments.

#loan_analysis
I'll generate a Word report summarizing key insights, including:

âœ… Loan repayment trends
âœ… Borrower demographics
âœ… Default & past due patterns
âœ… Charts & tables for better visualization

I'll generate the report now! ðŸš€ â€‹
